1.  How did we even get ActiveRecord (or any gem) involved in our gem (or Ruby program)?

- included in our Gemfile (or gemspec)
- we ran `bundle install` to ensure it exists on our machine
- we `require` it in our environment file

2.  How do I actually build my database?  How do I inform ActiveRecord what tables to build and columns will be in those tables?

- with migrations

  2a.  What tool do we use to build our migrations?
    - rake tasks, which will come from one of three sources:
      1. standalone_migrations gem
      2. sinatra/active_record/rake or something like
      3. rails/ActiveRecord/rake
 - migrations build the structure of the database
 - once migrated, our schema shows us what the database structure currently is

 3.  How about the Ruby side of things?  How do we tell ActiveRecord what models we're using (how do we build the classes?)

   - we build classes that inherit from ActiveRecord::Base
   - ActiveRecord gives us getters and setters based on our schema (migrations)
