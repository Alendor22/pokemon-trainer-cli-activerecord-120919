Goals:

- establish a relationship between a trainer and pokemon... <<---

  What does this relationship look like? ^^^
  - A trainer has many pokemon.
  - A pokemon belongs to a trainer.
  - a `has_many`/`belongs_to` relationship... (FOR NOW)
  - let's allow creation of a pokemon to include associating its trainer... and if the trainer doesn't already exist, create the trainer too!

  - THEN... we will look at a more complex way to do this.... which may include a JOIN TABLE

- (stretch) finish out any CRUD abilities between trainers & pokemon
